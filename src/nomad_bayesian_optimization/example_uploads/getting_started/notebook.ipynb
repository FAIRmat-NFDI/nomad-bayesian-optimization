    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a Bayesian optimization task with manual acquisition. Manual acquisition means that although this notebook will propose what kind of new samples should be created, NOMAD users will need to create them manually. This is required when the sample creation cannot be automated or fully controlled by the notebook, e.g. they require manual work in a lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Bayesian Optimization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian Optimization is a technique for finding the best solution to a problem when testing every possible option is too time-consuming or expensive. Imagine you're trying to make the perfect cake, but each ingredient combination takes a lot of time and effort to try. Instead of baking every possible cake, Bayesian Optimization helps you decide which combinations to try next, based on what you’ve learned so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does this by building a \"probability model\" that predicts how good different options might be. After trying a few options, the model suggests the next best option to test—one that has a good chance of being the best or teaches you something new. Over time, this approach zeroes in on the best solution without needing to try everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is widely used in areas like machine learning, where testing models can be very expensive, or in engineering, where designing experiments can be costly. It’s like having a smart assistant that helps you explore the most promising paths first, saving you time and resources."

    "# 2. Defining the search space\n",
    "\n",
    "The first task is to define the search space for the optimization. This simply means that we give a list of the parameters that can be controlled, and some kind of reasonable limits for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the NOMAD context, this means that we define a list of `quantities` that are used as the inputs, and give them some ranges. These quantities need to be part of some existing schema that describes the samples that will be created. E.g. for an experiment, they could be quantities in a schema that describes how the sample is created. If you do not already have a schema for the samples you are working with, please head over to our documentation on creating new schemas."

Here you can control how this acquisition step should be performed by the algorithm by e.g. balancing between \"exploration\" and \"exploitation\": we can control how adventurously we wish the algorithm to pick new samples, taking into account the existing samples. If starting a new acquisition from scratch, we often need to make the process in two steps: First we pick samples more or less randomly from the search space, after which we start another approach that takes the gained knowledge into account.\n",
